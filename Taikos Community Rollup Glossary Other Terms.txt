This is in contrast to <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#general-purpose-rollup"">general-purpose rollups</a> which support arbitrary computations.
"
"Arithmetic circuit"|"
The computation model of ZK-<a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#SNARK"">SNARKs</a>."

They consist of the <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#layer-2"">L2</a> <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#transaction"">transactions</a> that are rolled up, along with some metadata. Blobs are introduced as a new transaction type within Ethereum with <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Proto-danksharding-(EIP-4844)"">EIP-4844</a>), and has rollup scaling specifically in mind. Blobs persist on Ethereum’s Beacon Chain ephemerally.
"

"
"Block"|"
An ordered list of <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Transaction"">transactions</a> and chain-related metadata that gets bundled together and published to the <a href=""Layer-1"">L1</a>/<a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#Data-availability"">DA</a> layer. <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#node"">Nodes</a> execute the transactions contained within blocks to change the <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#Rollup"">rollup</a> chain’s state. Protocol rules dictate what constitutes a valid block, and invalid blocks are skipped over.
"
"Bridge"|"
A message-passing protocol between two blockchains (between <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#layer-1"">L1</a> and <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#layer-2"">L2</a>, and between L2s). At its most basic, a bridge consists of a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#smart-contract"">smart contract</a> which can escrow funds on one side of the bridge, and instruct the release or minting of corresponding assets on the other side. How these instructions are <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Validator"">validated</a> is a critical factor in assessing the trust assumptions of a bridge.
"
"Bulletproofs"|"
A type of zero-knowledge proof that enables efficient range proofs and other mathematical proofs without requiring trusted setup.
"
"Bytecode"|"
Generally, an instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter or a virtual machine. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecode is expressed numerically.

Most optimistic rollups currently specify a challenge window of 7 days. By extending the period, there is more time for participants to guard against fraud (invalid state transitions), but also more time until <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#finality"">finality</a> is reached.
"
"Circuit"|"
A program written for the purposes of being <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Prover"">proven</a> within a proving system. A circuit is a mathematical representation of the computation to be executed, and is therefore sometimes referred to as an arithmetic circuit. Circuits can be written in different languages, ranging from low-level to high-level.
"
"Client"|"
Sometimes labelled interchangeably as a “<a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#node"">node</a>”, they are tasked with processing <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Transaction"">transactions</a> and managing the <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#Rollup"">rollup</a>’s state. They run the computations for each transaction according to the rollup’s virtual machine and protocol rules. If comparing to Ethereum clients, these would be execution clients such as <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Geth"">Geth</a>, as opposed to <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Consensus"">consensus</a> clients.
"
"Consensus"|"
An agreement on the latest and correct state of a blockchain. Unlike <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#layer-1"">L1</a>
 blockchains which coordinate participating <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Node"">nodes</a> with consensus rules, <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#rollup"">rollups</a> rely on L1s for reaching consensus by checking the state of the rollup <a href=""Rollup-contracts"">smart contract</a>
 deployed thereon.
"
"Compatibility"|"

Today, this typically refers to how well rollups and developers thereon can make use of the <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Ethereum-Virtual-Machine-(EVM)"">Ethereum Virtual machine</a>, existing <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Smart-contract"">smart contracts</a>, and other Ethereum infrastructure.
"
"Commitment Scheme"|"
A cryptographic primitive that (i) allows one (usually a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#prover"">prover</a>) to commit to a chosen statement and send this commitment to the <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#verifier"">verifier</a> while keeping it hidden to others, and (ii) allows verifier to check the commitment and accept or reject it.
The commitment scheme should satisfy two properties: (i) it should be binding; that is, once the prover has committed she is bound to the message she has committed, (ii) it should be hiding; that is, the commitment reveals nothing new about the message to the verifier.
"
"Completeness"|"
One of three properties of <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#zero-knowledge-proof"">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, completeness states that if a statement is true, an honest <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#verifier"">verifier</a> will be convinced of this by an honest <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#prover"">prover</a>.
"
"Danksharding"|"
A sharding design proposed for Ethereum. Instead of providing more space for transactions, Ethereum sharding provides more space for <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#blobs"">blobs</a> of data. Verifying a blob simply requires checking that the blob is available - that it can be downloaded from the <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Network"">network</a>. The data space in these blobs is expected to be used by <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#Layer-2"">layer-2</a>
 rollup protocols.
In comparison to other sharding mechanisms, where there are a fixed number of shards with distinct <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Block"">blocks</a> and distinct block <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Proposer"">proposers</a>, in Danksharding there is only one proposer that chooses all transactions and all data that go into that slot.
"
"Determinism"|"
The concept of some function or process having a single outcome that is knowable by all participants. In the context of a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#Rollup"">rollup</a>, it generally refers to the new state being calculable given a prior state and a list of <a href="#Transaction"">transactions</a> to be executed.
"

A stack-based virtual machine that executes <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#bytecode"">bytecode</a>. In Ethereum, the execution model specifies how the system state is altered given a series of bytecode instructions and a small tuple of environmental data. In the context of <a href=/spicy-terms#Rollup"">rollups</a>
, the EVM is a choice of execution environment that rollups could implement, as in the case of EVM ZK-Rollups (<a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#ZK-EVM"">ZK-EVMs</a>) and EVM <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#optimistic-rollup"">optimistic rollups</a>.
"
"Execution environment"|"
Refers to both the environment where transactions are processed, constituted by the execution <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#client"">clients</a>, as well as the virtual machine model which the <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Client"">clients</a> run.
"
"Equivalence"|"
A perfect degree of <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#compatibility"">compatibility</a>; where one system or concept is indistinguishable from another in the domain being compared. In the context of <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#Rollup"">rollups</a>, it generally refers to the proximity to the <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Ethereum-Virtual-Machine-(EVM)"">EVM</a>
 and to Ethereum architecture.
"
"Escape hatch"|"
The facility for any user of a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#Rollup"">rollup</a> to exit the system with their assets under any circumstance. Most relevant in rollups with a centralized <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#proposer"">proposer</a>, wherein users do not have the ability to propose <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Block"">blocks</a>, but can nonetheless exit the rollup by interacting with a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Smart-contract"">smart ontract</a>
 on <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Layer-1"">L1</a>.
"
"Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)"|"
An algorithm that computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence in a more efficient manner; that is, taking O(n * log(n)) instead of O(n * n). It is used for extremely fast multiplication of large numbers, multiplication of polynomials, and extremely fast generation and recovery of erasure codes.
"
"Fiat-Shamir heuristic"|"
A method of converting interactive proofs into non-interactive proofs, commonly used in zero-knowledge protocols.
"
"Fraud proof"|"
Also referred to as a fault proof, it is the construction of an assertion that fraud was perpetrated on an <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#optimisitc-rollup"">optimistic rollup</a>. More concretely, that an invalid state transition took place according to the protocol rules. The submitter of a fraud proof would expect a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Rewards"">reward</a> from the optimistic rollup protocol for helping maintain the integrity of the system.
"
"FRI"|"
A proximity test method that is used to determine whether a set of points is mostly on a polynomial with a degree less than a specified value. It resembles the <a href=""Fast-Fourier-transform-(FFT)"">FFT</a>
 but the arithmetic complexity of its <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Prover"">prover</a> is strictly linear and that of the <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Verifier"">verifier</a> is strictly logarithmic.
"
"Gas"|"
A virtual fuel used to execute <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#smart-contract"">smart contracts</a> on a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#rollup"">rollup</a>. The <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Ethereum-Virtual-Machine-(EVM)"">EVM</a> (or other VM within the rollup) uses an accounting mechanism to correspond the consumption of gas to the consumption of computing resources, and to limit the consumption of computing resources.

Running Geth alongside a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Consensus"">consensus</a> client turns a computer into a full Ethereum <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Node"">node</a>, or <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Validator"">validator</a>.
"
"Halo"|"
The first recursive proof composition without a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Trusted-setup-(ceremony)"">trusted setup</a>. A proof <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Verifier"">verifies</a> the correctness of another instance of itself, meaning that the latest mathematical output (one single proof) contains within it a proof that all prior claims to the relevant secret knowledge have themselves been sufficiently proven through a similar process. It allows any amount of computational effort and data to produce a short proof that can be checked quickly.
"
"Hash"|"
A fixed-length fingerprint of variable-size input, produced by a hash function.

A <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Polynomial-commitment"">polynomial commitment</a> scheme that allows a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Prover"">prover</a> to compute a commitment to a polynomial, with the properties that this commitment can later be opened at any position: The prover shows that the value of the polynomial at a certain position is equal to a claimed value.
KZG is widely used as it’s applicable both for univariate and k-variate polynomials, is efficient for batch proofs, and is able to generate many proofs at once relatively fast. It is also proof generation time efficient: the time for prover to commit to a polynomial is linear on the degree of the polynomial.

Blockchains started receiving the moniker of layer 1 once <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#Layer-2"">layer 2</a> became a meaningful area of development.
"
"Lookup table"|"
Lookup tables express a relation between variables in the format of a table. A <a href=""Prover"">prover</a>
 can rely on such a table of precomputed values in generating a proof without having to do bit by bit arithmetic. These tables can help handle hash functions within <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Circuit>circuits</a>
 in a more friendly manner (that is speeding up decryption and reducing memory requirements).

Short for ""<a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Succinctness"">succinct</a> non-interactive argument of knowledge"", a SNARK is a widely used type of <a href=""Verifier"">verify</a>
. Different kinds of SNARKs are usually systematized by proof size, verification time, and type of <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Trusted-setup"">setup</a>. The most famous SNARKs are Groth16, <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#PLONK"">PLONK</a>/Marlin, Bulletproofs, and <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#STARK"">STARKs</a>.

"STARK"|"
Short for ""<a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#Scalability"">scalable</a> transparent argument of knowledge"", a STARK is a type of <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#SNARK"">SNARKs</a>, its reliance on a ""<a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Trusted-setup"">trusted setup</a>”. STARKs also come with much simpler cryptographic assumptions, avoiding the need for elliptic curves, pairings, and the knowledge-of-exponent assumption and instead relying purely on <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Hash"">hashes</a> and information theory. This means that they are secure even against attackers with quantum computers.
"
"Succinctness"|"
A property of <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Verifier"">verify</a> the proof is faster than just to evaluate the function from scratch.
"
"Time Delay"|"
In regards to <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#Upgradeability"">upgradeability</a>, a predefined amount of time that must elapse before the <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#Rollup"">rollup</a> <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Smart-contract"">smart contracts</a> or parameters are updated. This protects users from malicious upgrades by giving them time to exit the rollup before upgrades come into effect.
"
"Transaction"|"
Data committed to the Ethereum Blockchain signed by an originating account, targeting a specific address. The transaction contains metadata such as the <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Gas-limit"">gas limit</a> for that <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Transaction"">transaction</a>.
"
"Threshold cryptography"|"
A type of cryptography where multiple parties jointly hold a secret key and must cooperate to perform cryptographic operations, enabling more secure and decentralized system.
"
"Trusted setup (ceremony)"|"
Generation of a piece of data that must then be used for some cryptographic protocol to run. Generating this data requires some secret information. The ""trust"" comes from the fact that a person generates a secret, uses it to generate the data, and then publishes the data and forgets the secret. Once the data is generated, and the secrets are forgotten, no further participation from the creators of the ceremony is required.
There are two types of trusted setup: (i) trusted setup per <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Circuit"">circuit</a> where it is generated from scratch for each circuit, (ii) trusted universal (updatable) setup where it can be used for as many circuits as we want.
"
"Trustlessness"|"
The ability of a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Network"">network</a> to mediate <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Transaction"">transactions</a> without any of the involved parties needing to trust a third party.
"
"Turing completeness"|"
A system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be ""Turing-complete"" or ""computationally universal"" if it is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets.
"
"Validator"|"
A <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#node"">node</a> in a blockchain system responsible for processing transactions, and adding or <a href=""Verifier"">verifying</a>
 new <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Block"">blocks</a> to the blockchain. 
"
"Validity proof"|"
The output of a cryptographic proving system attesting to correct computation. <a href=""ZK-Rollup"">ZK-Rollups</a> use <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Succinctness"">succinct</a> validity proofs (also called <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Zero-knowledge-proof-(ZKP)"">zero-knowledge proofs</a>) to <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Prover"">prove</a> a batch of <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#rollup"">rollup</a> <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Transaction"">transactions</a> and <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Block"">blocks</a> were properly executed. Validity proofs are submitted to a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Verifier"">verifier</a>, such as an Ethereum <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Smart-contract"">smart contract</a>, which accepts them if properly constructed.
"
"Validium"|"
An off-chain solution that uses <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Validity-proofs"">validity proofs</a> to improve <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Transaction"">transaction</a> throughput. Unlike <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#ZK-Rollup"">Zero-knowledge rollups</a>, validium data isn't stored on <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Layer-1"">layer 1</a> Mainnet.
"
"Verifier"|"
An entity in a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#ZK-Rollup"">ZK-Rollup</a>, often a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Smart-contract"">smart contract</a>, that verifies <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Zero-knowledge-proof-(ZKP)"">zero-knowledge proofs</a> submitted by a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Prover"">prover</a>.
"
"Verkle tree"|"
A data storage format of which you can make a proof that it contains some pieces of data to anyone who has the root of the tree. While similar to <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Merkle-tree"">Merkle Patricia Trees</a>, key differences include a much wider tree format which leads to smaller proof sizes.
"
"Volition"|"
A hybrid <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#data-availability"">data availability</a> mode, where the user can choose whether to place data on-chain or off-chain.
"
"Zero-knowledge"|"
A cryptographic technology and sub-discipline of cryptography that allows an individual to <a href="#Prover"">prove</a> that a statement or computation is true without revealing any additional information.
"
"Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)"|"
A zero-knowledge proof is the resulting output of a <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Zero-knowledge"">zero-knowledge</a> cryptographic method.
"
"ZK-Rollup"|"
A <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/spicy-terms#rollup"">rollup</a> that uses <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Zero-knowledge-proof-(ZKP)"">ZKPs</a> (also often called <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Validity-proof"">validity proofs</a> to <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Validator"">validate</a> the correctness of the state transition function and update the rollup state. This is one of two main types of rollup constructions, along with <a href=""https://rollup-glossary.vercel.app/#Optimistic-rollup"">optimistic rollups</a>. In general, ZK-Rollups do not provide privacy preserving properties; privacy preserving ZK-Rollups are sometimes called ZK-ZK-Rollups.
